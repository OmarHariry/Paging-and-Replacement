# Paging-and-Replacement
It is required to simulate some of paging replacement algorithms. The required algorithms to
be implemented are as follows:
• Optimal
• First In First Out (FIFO)
• Least Recently Used (LRU)
• Clock
Compile the program using: 
make
cat inputCLOCK.txt | ./lab4 | diff outputCLOCK.txt
